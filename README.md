# Banking-application-with-parallelism.
Banking operations which ensures parallelism with distributed manner written in java programming.
Banking Application for Parallel and Distributed computing System

    Purpose about Project:
        Parallel computing introduces models and architectures for performing multiple tasks within a single computing node or a set of tightly coupled nodes with homogeneous hardware.
        Parallelism to increase the performance of a computing system, depending on whether parallelism is realized on data, instructions, or both. 
        In this Project, parallelism is achieved through data and internal software structure.
       
    Requirements:
        Netbeans,Eclipse (latest version)
        Language: Java Programming
    Flow of the project:
        Step 1: Create a java web application. In the HTML file design your page and requirements as you want.
        Step 2: Create 3 servlet class (serv,serv2,serv3) paste the code in it.
        Step 3: Create a two databases under which create one table in each connection. Give same data for both table.
        Step 4: Run and test it.
